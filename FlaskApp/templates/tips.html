        <h2>1. Starting Hands</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right starting hands is crucial in Texas Hold'em. Focus on playing strong hands like high pairs (e.g., AA, KK), high cards of the same suit (e.g., AK, AQ), and connected cards (e.g., 10-J, 9-10).</p>

        <h2>2. Position Matters</h2>
        <p>Your position at the table can significantly impact your strategy. Play tighter (more conservative) from early positions and looser (more aggressive) from late positions.</p>

        <h2>3. Pay Attention to Opponents</h2>
        <p>Observe your opponents' playing styles. Adapt your strategy based on their tendencies. Are they aggressive or passive? Do they bluff often?</p>

        <h2>4. Be Mindful of Your Image</h2>
        <p>Consider how others perceive your playing style. If you've been playing aggressively, use that image to your advantage. If you've been playing conservatively, surprise your opponents with a well-timed bluff.</p>

        <h2>5. Bluffing and Semi-Bluffing</h2>
        <p>Master the art of bluffing, but use it selectively. Semi-bluffing with drawing hands adds another layer to your strategy. It can force opponents to fold or build a big pot if the draw hits.</p>

        <h2>6. Pot Odds and Expected Value</h2>
        <p>Understand pot odds and expected value to make more informed decisions. Calculate the odds of completing your drawing hand compared to the size of the pot to determine if a call is profitable in the long run.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Adjust Based on Table Dynamics</h2>
        <p>Stay flexible and adapt to changing dynamics at the table. If the table is tight, loosen up. If it's loose, tighten your range. Be aware of your opponents' adjustments and make counter-strategies.</p>
